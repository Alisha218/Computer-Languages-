The provided code is an assembly language program for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed to run in a DOS environment. It uses the x86 architecture and DOS interrupts for input and output. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the code:

Key Components
Data Section:

The .DATA segment contains various strings and variables used throughout the game, including:
The Tic-Tac-Toe logo (T1, T2, T3, T4).
Game rules (R, R1, R2, etc.).
Player markers (PC1 for Player 1, PC2 for Player 2).
Cell numbers (C1 to C9).
Messages for winning, drawing, and prompts for user input.
Code Section:

The .CODE segment contains the main logic of the game, including:
Displaying the title screen and game rules.
Initializing game variables.
Handling player turns and input.
Checking for winning conditions or a draw.
Displaying the game board.
Allowing players to play again or exit.
Game Flow
Title Screen: The game starts by displaying a logo and a prompt to continue.
Game Rules: After pressing a key, the game rules are displayed.
Game Initialization: Variables are initialized, including player markers and move counters.
Player Turns: Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a cell number (1-9).
Input Validation: The program checks if the input is valid (between 1-9) and if the selected cell is already taken.
Winning Conditions: After each move, the program checks for winning conditions (three in a row) or a draw (if all cells are filled).
Display Board: The current state of the board is displayed after each move.
End of Game: If a player wins or if the game is a draw, a message is displayed, and players are prompted to play again or exit.
Important Functions
Display Functions: The program uses DOS interrupt INT 21H to display strings and messages on the screen.
Input Handling: It uses INT 21H for reading user input, both with and without echo.
Cursor Control: The program uses INT 10H to set the cursor position for displaying text.
Example of Game Logic
Checking for a Win: The CHECK section contains logic to check all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) after each move.
Handling Invalid Input: If a player enters an invalid cell number or selects a taken cell, the program informs the player and prompts for input again.
Conclusion
This assembly language program is a complete implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, showcasing fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling in a low-level programming environment. It serves as a good example for learning assembly language and understanding how to manage game logic and user interaction in a console application.
